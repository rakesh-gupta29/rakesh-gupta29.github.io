    <h6 class="text-white text-opacity-80 pt-7 max-w-xl leading-relaxed">
      Started my career at a design agency â€” developed a UX-first approach and an
      eye and appreciation for visuals. That mindset still drives how I build:
      clean interfaces, intuitive flows, and real-world usability.

      Now, working on a product with a small team, I believe in power and speed of iterations, rather than making perfect plans.
