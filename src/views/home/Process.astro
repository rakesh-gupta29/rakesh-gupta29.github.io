    <h6 class="text-white text-opacity-80 pt-7 max-w-xl leading-relaxed">
      Started my career at a design agencyâ€”developed a UX-first approach and an
      eye and appreciation for visuals. That mindset still drives how I build:
      clean interfaces, intuitive flows, and real-world usability.

    <h6 class="text-white text-opacity-80 pt-7 max-w-xl leading-relaxed">
      Now, in product development, I am working with small team, where we belive
      in shipping fast rather than making perfect plans.
